<H1>William G. Faris: Research Interests</H1>

<P>
My research interests are in mathematical physics and in
applied probability. Among the topoics: </P>


<ul>
  <li> The Feynman path integral of quantum mechanics </li>
  <li> The theory of self-adjoint operators acting in Hilbert space </li>
  <li> Stochastic partial differential equations </li>
  <li> Neural networks </li>
  <li> Wave propagation in random media </li>
  <li> Equlibrium statistical mechanics </li>
  <li> Cluster expansions </li>
</ul>

<P> 
My writings also include books on a number of other subjects, including:  </P>


<ul>
  <li> Logic (an approach through proof theory) </li>
  <li> Vector fields and differential forms (with pictures) </li>
  <li> Real analysis </li>
  <li> Martingales </li>
  </ul>
