<h1>THE MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA</h1>

<h2>by Richard S. Pierce, 1984</h2>

<p>In the beginning there was mathematics; it has been with us ever since.
Formal university training in mathematics came to Arizona about five years
after the Territorial assembly pronounced its blessing on higher education in
1885.

</p>

<p> In those frontier days, mathematics was embedded in the College of
Mines. The School of Mathematics in 1892 consisted of departments of Pure
Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. The courses that were given under the
banner of pure mathematics in those days seem to be roughly equivalent to the
current offerings of most Tucson high schools: elementary algebra, plane
geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. The applied Mathematics offerings were
more sophisticated, though they would not be classified as mathematics
today. These courses included mechanics, strength of materials, and
astronomy.

</p>

<p>To establish some perspective, it is useful to survey the status of
mathematics in this country at the end of the nineteenth century. During its
early years, these United States had a surprising number of scientists who
clearly rank among the leading geniuses of the times. However, before about
1900, there were only a few native born Americans who could be called world
class mathematicians; J. W. Gibbs, G. A. Miller, and C. S. Peirce were
recognized names in 1890 or earlier. In any case, the mathematical center of
gravity in this country at the turn of the century was well east of the
Mississippi river. To be sure, 1900 was a time of mathematical excitement in
the eastern centers such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Johns Hopkins, but
the ripples from this ferment did not reach the sands of Arizona. As we
noted, the mathematical curriculum at the youthful University of Arizona was
just a few steps above standard high school offerings. However, the same
statement could probably be made about the most distinguished universities in
their early years of existence.

</p>

<p>During its first twenty years, the Mathematics Department at the
University of Arizona grew at a leisurely pace. Calculus was expanded from
one to three quarters; some remedial courses such as beginning algebra,
geometry, and trigonometry were dropped (but of course rose from the ashes in
more recent times); and the catalog picked up a few advanced specialties such
as "computation," "higher plane curves," and a "synoptic course in advanced
mathematics." Appropriately, mathematics education took an honored place in
the curriculum. The evidence indicates that many of the mathematics majors
from the University during the period between 1900 and 1920 graduated to the
teaching profession.

</p>

<p>The condensation of mathematics into an important part of the
University's program started at about the time of World War One. The leader
of this development was Dr. Heman Leonard. He joined the faculty in 1915,
became the first officially recognized department head in 1920, and served in
that role until 1938. During this time, the mathematics major was formalized
with the available degrees of B.A., B.S., and M.S. The records of the
Department show that a B.S. in mathematics was awarded to Josephine Walters in
1918. For lack of contrary evidence, it can be assumed that she was the first
of Arizona's mathematics degree graduates. The first graduate degree in
mathematics was awarded to Samuel Ridgely in 1921. His M.S. thesis dealt with
the rotation of an ellipsoid about a non-principal axis, a topic in the
English Tripos tradition. Clearly, mathematics in the southwest had not
caught up with the exciting developments that were taking place in the main
centers of learning around the country and the world. It was the period
between 1910 and 1930 that saw the birth of functional analysis, algebraic
topology, abstract algebra, mathematical logic, general relativity, and
quantum mechanics. A non-mathematical event of importance for Arizona ocurred
during that time period: Arizona became the forty-eighth member of the United
States of America in 1912.

</p>

<p>The second head of the Mathematics Department at the University of
Arizona was Dr. Roy Graesser. He served in that capacity from 1938 until
1959. These were the years of World War Two and the Korean War. The times
were difficult, and it is probably not surprising that the record of progress
during that period is slender.

</p>

<p>In 1959 the headship of the Mathematics Department passed from Graesser
to Dr. Harvey Cohn, a distinguished number theorist. Under his direction the
department grew from adolescence to young adulthood in the intellectual
community of mathematics. A Ph.D. program was initiated around 1960. Its
first product was Marcus Bernard who graduated in 1962. The start of a
doctoral program is generally recognized as the first step that a department
takes toward academic respectability; the step was taken rather late here in
Arizona. By comparison, Berkeley's mathematics department produced 34 Ph.D.
graduates in 1962 even though the University of California was founded only
thirty years before the University of Arizona. Nevertheless, the doctoral
program here has prospered. Approximately eighty mathematical scholars have
followed Marcus Bernard across an Arizona graduation platform to accept the
rights and privileges that are conferred with a doctorate of philosophy. Two
of those graduates are among the present faculty at Arizona.

</p>

<p>At the time when Harvey Cohn took the assignment to build a mathematics
department of high quality, there were conflicting forces in the academic
marketplace. On the one hand, global technological competition was becoming
evident, and there was a realization that, the race would be lost by countries
without excellent mathematical training centers. As a result, the money
needed to build a department was in a free flow mode by current standards.
However, the supply of high quality faculty lagged behind the demand. While
it was easy for the prestige institutions like Harvard, Princeton, Chicago,
and Berkeley to pick and choose among the best of the doctoral graduates each
year, the schools with young departments "on-the-make" found themselves
scrambling for the leftovers. Unfortunately, the Mathematics Department at
Arizona was in the tail-end group. In spite of the tight market, Arizona's
Mathematics Department did improve during the 1960's, both in its faculty and
in its programs.

</p>

<p>One of the creative ways in which the general manpower shortage was
circumvented during the 1960's was by hiring senior mathematicians who had
retired from other universities. The Mathematics Department at Arizona was
outstandingly effective in the use of this strategy. Two of the world's
leading number theorists came to Arizona--one for a short time, the other one
for several years. In 1963, Louis J. Mordell joined the Arizona faculty as a
visiting Professor. An American by birth, Mordell gained his fame in the
English University system, where he pursued his research on Diophantine
equations and helped to build a tradition of number theory that is one of the
strongest in the world. Mordell's name has surfaced in the news this year
(1984) because of an amazing conjecture of his that has recently been proved
by a young German mathematician. Mordell's stay in Arizona was short, but
another distinguished number theorist, Henry Mann, spent seven years at the
University of Arizona from 1968 until his retirement in 1975. He was
influential in the development of a strong group of number theorists within
the department. Another distinguished English mathematician, Louis Milne-
Thompson spent several years at the University of Arizona. He directed
numerous Ph.D. theses in his specialty area, hydrodynamics.

</p>

<p>After Cohn resigned in 1967, the departmental leadership passed through
the hands of four acting heads, while a search was made for a permanent
director. It was during this interim period (in 1969) that the mathematics
department moved from the Physics Building to its present quarters, the X
shaped Mathematics Building. Construction of the Mathematics Building was
supported in part by funds from the National Science Foundation. An addition
to the building was made in 1970. It is now the home of the Mathematics
Department, the linguistics department, and several other smaller units of the
university.

</p>

<p>A new permanent head for the Mathematics Department was found in 1970.
Dr. Hanno Rund came from Waterloo University to the University of Arizona to
take the leadership of the Department during the period between 1970 and
1978. He energetically pursued the development program that had been
initiated by Cohn, adding more than a dozen new faculty members.

</p>

<p>One of the important occurrences in the history of mathematics at the
University of Arizona was the introduction around 1977 of an interdisciplinary
group in Applied Mathematics. Mathematics is used and taught in many of the
university programs. The faculty members who view themselves as
mathematicians are by no means confined to the Mathematics Department. The
formal recognition of a common bond of interest that links a large group of
people on campus came about with the formation of the Committee on Applied
Mathematics. This committee consists of several dozen faculty members from
various areas, including the Mathematics Department of course. Some of the
most interesting and exciting mathematical developments in Arizona during the
last eight years have occurred under the stimulus of the Applied Mathematics
Committee.

</p>

<p>The most recent department head came from among the existing faculty.
Dr. Theodore Laetsch served with distinction in this position from 1978 to
1984. He has vigorously continued the work of his predecessors to raise the
quality of research and teaching of mathematics in Arizona.

</p>

<p>In general, bare statistics are deadly dull and uninformative. However,
a listing of the numbers of faculty at various ranks over the last thirty
years does convey some sense of the development of mathematics at the
University of Arizona. Here is such a table.

</p>

<p>
<table border = "1">
<tr><th>	<th>Professor	<th>Assoc.	Prof.	<th>Asst.	Prof.	<th>Inst.	<th>Lecturer	<th>Total  </tr>
<tr>   <td>1955 </td>  <td>	2 </td>  <td>	1 </td>  <td>	6  </td>  <td>	1	</td>  <td>0</td>  <td>	10  </td>   </tr>

<p>The moral of the table seems to be: we are growing older, not much fatter,
hopefully wiser.

</p>

<p>We conclude this brief history with comments on the flavor of current
research activity in the Department of Mathematics at the University of
Arizona. The goal of this exercise is to point out some of the features that
distinguish the Department from its counterparts around the country, to
describe the special problems and special promises of the Department, and to
provide a background for the Department's plans for future development.
Perhaps our greatest asset is the orientation of a large fraction of the
research faculty toward science and engineering. In this respect, the
Department is ahead of many other schools in the country. Many mathematics
departments have neglected the applications of their subject to other
sciences. At Arizona this has not been the case. In fact, the Department's
orientation toward applications was a choice that was made by some of its top
researchers, not out of necessity, but because they thought that the
applications of mathematics provide the greatest scientific rewards. This
viewpoint has had a positive effect on teaching. Some of the best and most
enthusiastic students in the mathematics courses come from science and
engineering. They expect to learn robust and exciting material on the
frontiers of mathematics, and their eagerness stimulates the faculty to
respond with high quality teaching and research.

</p>

<p>The mathematical area that provides most of the interaction with science
and engineering fields is analysis. The Department is active in several parts
of analysis, including differential and integral equations, functional
analysis, operator theory, and global analysis. There is also considerable
effort in areas related to mainstream analysis, such as probability and
stochastic processes, statistics, and numerical analysis.

</p>

<p>Algebra and number theory are well represented in the research of the
Department. Group theory, ring theory, and field theory are actively pursued
by various members of the faculty. There is also some research in peripheral
parts of algebra: logic, combinatorics, and lattice theory. These are aspects
of algebra that have important applications to computer science and
linguistics.

</p>

<p>The Department's greatest weaknesses are in areas of geometry, such as
topology, Lie groups, and algebraic geometry. Strengthening research in
geometry would provide a more balanced program, and it would support the
present research efforts of the Department's two most active groups: applied
analysis, and algebra/number theory.

</p>

<p>It is difficult to give a detailed portrayal of the Department's research
activity that fairly represents the diverse contributions made by individual
faculty members. However, some themes stand out. Describing one of them,
nonlinear analysis, may give an idea of why people get excited about
mathematics. Many advances in analysis over the last three centuries have
come about through a better understanding of linear problems. Roughly
speaking, these are problems where response is proportional to input. Some
mathematicians regard nonlinear problems as belonging to a category that
consists of a zoo of special examples. That perception is now changing.
There is a feeling that we are coming to a global understanding of non-linear
phenomena. A lot of work is still done on special examples, but there is now
some feeling for the existence of orderly patterns in nonlinear systems.
Nonlinear effects, rather than being a nuisance or hopeless or an invitation
to go blindly to the computer, are now viewed as sources of stability and
order. Examples of stability in nonlinear phenomena are the travelling waves
of combustion and nerve impulses, and the solitons of fluid dynamics and
nonlinear optics. In other circumstances, however, nonlinear effects are
responsible for disorder and instability. The separation between stability and
instability is among the most exciting problems in nonlinear science.
Researchers in probability and mathematical physics have also found that
nonlinearity can generate order. In very large strongly interacting systems
there is the phenomenon called phase transition. Small changes in a parameter
such as temperature can suddenly produce a new ordered phase (condensation or
crystalization). The mathematics of this physical effect is poorly
understood, but the central questions are now clear, and the mathematical
tools that come naturally to hand in the study of phase transitions have
remarkably fruitful analogs in probability theory.

</p>

<p>What will the future bring? Limited resources make it impossible to
develop every area of mathematics. We will have to decide what parts of
mathematical research are most important--to the university, the state and the
nation. The decision will have to take account of the ultimate value of
mathematical research, its utility, and its prestige value to the Department.

</p>

<p>Faculty and students need to be aware of the main current developments in
mathematics. They need access to specialist who can tell them about the
latest results on Thurston's classification program for three-dimensional
manifolds, or the structure of finite simple groups. The mathematics faculty
should also be ready to explore the new ideas that live at the frontier
between mathematics and other sciences. There will be a demand for experts on
such new developments as the transition to turbulence or the algebraic aspects
of programming languages. Can the Department keep up with current
mathematical developments and contribute to them in significant ways? It will
certainly try to do so, and the evidence of the Department's past development
suggests that the effort will be successful.
